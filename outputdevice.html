    <h1>Monitor</h1>
    <p>A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures for computers. Monitors often look similar to
        televisions. The main difference between a monitor and a television is that a monitor does not have a television
        tuner to change channels. Monitors often have higher display resolution than televisions. A high display
        resolution makes it easier to see smaller letters and fine graphics.

        There are three types of computer displays:

        The CRT monitor. These are big and heavy and use a lot of desk space and electricity. It is the oldest
        technology used by monitors and is based on the cathode ray tube technology that was developed for television.
        Monitors are made with better parts which give a higher display resolution and picture sharpness than a
        television. This type of monitor is no longer popular.

        LCD Flat panel. Much thinner and lighter than monitors with a cathode ray tube.
        The LCD monitor, the most common kind of flat panel display. It is a newer technology than CRT. LCD monitors use
        much less desk space, are lightweight and use less electricity than CRT. They have been used for many years in
        the screens of laptop and notebook computers. They also work as touch screens in tablet computers, mobile
        phones, and other handheld technologies.
        An LED Monitor (short for Light Emitting Diode) or LED display is an LCD Monitor that uses light emitting diodes
        for backlighting. The first LCD Monitors used cold cathode fluorescent lamps instead of LEDs to illuminate the
        screen.
        In the early 21st century the price of video projectors has fallen and they are now used in many places to show
        large images. These use various technologies to make the image including LCD - Liquid crystal display and DLP -
        Digital light processing which uses very small mirrors to direct the light..</p>
    <h1>Headphones</h1>
    <p>A computer headphone is an output device electronic audio devices that people wear over their ears. They let
        people hear sounds on a walkman, MP3 player, mobile phone or computer. Headphones come in many different sizes
        from big to small. They are also known as earphones, stereophones, headsets or even 'cans'. Earbuds are inserted
        into the ear. Headphones typically uses small plug for connection. Some use a Bluetooth connection so they
        don't have the cord in the way.

        There is a risk of deafness if listening to headphones with a high volume for a long time.</p>
