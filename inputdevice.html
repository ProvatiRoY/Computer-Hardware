    <h1>Mouse</h1>
    <p>A computer mouse is an input device that is used with a computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move
        the cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pushing the mouse buttons (called
        clicking). Today's mouse have two buttons, the left button and right button, with a scroll wheel in between
        the two. Today, many computer mouse use wireless technology and have no wire.

        There are many types of mouse. Optical mouse, wireless mouse, mechanical mouse, trackball mouse. A computer
        mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI and can move and select text, icons,
        files, and folders. For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface such as a mouse pad or a desk
        and is placed in front of your computer. The picture to the right is an example of a desktop computer mouse with
        two buttons and a wheel. The mouse was originally known as the X-Y position Indicator for a display system and
        was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1963 while working at Xerox PARC. However, due to Alto's lack of success,
        the first widely used application of the mouse was with the Apple Lisa computer.

        Today this device is on virtually every computer. The primary function is to move the mouse pointer on the
        screen. The mouse pointer can be used for many actions on the computer. Clicking or double clicking an icon,
        folder, or other object will open a document or execute the program. Users can also move an icon, folder, or
        other object by clicking a mouse button and dragging the object with the mouse pointer. Pointing to an item on
        the screen means moving your mouse so the pointer appears to be touching the item. When you point to something,
        a small box often appears that describes the item.In 1964 Douglas Engelbart (1925-2013), a researcher at
        Stanford Research Institute, wanted to find a way to make using computers easier. In those days, computers were
        large and expensive. Using them was very hard because everything had to be typed in on a keyboard. This command
        line interface is still used by some people, such as programmers, to get things done faster.
        The computer mouse began to be widely used when Xerox Palo Alto Research introduced a GUI in 1981, where the
        mouse was used to click things on the screen. This was also the case with the Macintosh operating system from
        Apple of Apple Inc when it came out in 1984, as well as Microsoft Windows. Windows became popular over the
        years, so over time computer mice became used with many computers.

        In 1991, the company Logitech invented the wireless mouse. Unlike a normal mouse, wireless mice were
        connected by radio signals. Newer wireless mice use Bluetooth or WiFi to connect wireless mice to
        computers.

        After studying and designing for a long time, Engelbart succeeded in inventing an input device which he named
        'XY index'. At first, it needed two hands to use, but it was changed so that only one hand was needed to use it.
        This model was more like the mouse that we use today, but was made up of a big ball that the user had to roll in
        different directions to move the cursor.On most computers, the user can move the mouse to move the cursor in the
        same direction. To choose something that is on the screen, the user can move the cursor to it and "click" the
        left mouse button. The right button is used to open menus that are different depending on where the cursor is.
        The other mouse buttons can do different things, depending on the software. Most mice have two buttons to click.

        Most mice also have the "scroll wheel"â€”a small wheel found between the two main mouse buttons. The user can move
        the wheel back and forth to "scroll" through things like a website or folder. "Scrolling" means moving the words
        or pictures up or down on the screen, so another part of the page comes into view. The wheel can also be
        pressed, to click it like another button.

        A mouse can also be connected to and used the same way with a laptop computer, but unlike a desktop computer,
        one does not have to be connected to use the laptop. This is because along with the keyboard, laptops have a
        built-in input device called a trackpad which does the same thing as a mouse. Similarly, tablet computers have a
        touchscreen as an input device, but some, like the Microsoft Surface and those that use Android, also work with
        mice.</p>
    <h1>Keyboard</h1>
    <p>A computer keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter letters, numbers, and other symbols
        (together, these are called characters) into a computer. It is one of the most used input devices for computers.
        Using a keyboard is often called typing.

        A keyboard contains many mechanical switches or push-buttons called "keys". When one of these are pushed, an
        electrical circuit is closed, and the keyboard sends a signal to the computer that tells it what letter, number
        or symbol it would like to be shown on the screen. The computer then shows the character on the screen, usually
        at the place where the flashing text cursor is.

        Besides entering characters, computer keyboards also have special keys that change the symbol (such as shift or
        caps lock) or give the computer special commands (such as the arrow keys, CTRL and ALT). Different computer
        operating systems use different special keys, or use them differently. Special commands can also be glizzie!
        activated through combinations of keys, called keyboard shortcuts. Some of the most common shortcuts on Windows
        programs are: Ctrl + C, to copy some text or a picture; Ctrl + V, to paste what was copied; and Ctrl + F, to
        find a certain word on a document or web page.

        A keyboard can be joined to a computer using a wire, but can also be wireless (like those that use Bluetooth).
        Most wired 21st century keyboards connect to a USB socket on the computer, but older ones use a round, purple
        DIN connector.There are different types of keyboards. They can be based on the way the keys work; for example,
        laptops have keys that do not move a lot, because the keyboard has to be very thin in order to fit inside the
        laptop. On the other hand, video game players often like keyboards with keys that move a lot, so that they feel
        the key working. Gaming keyboards also need fast reaction times. In between these two types, an ergonomic
        keyboard is made to be easier for people to type for long periods of time, without hurting their hands or arms.

        There are also different ways the keys on a keyboard are arranged, usually to deal with different regions and
        languages of the world. Most computer keyboards have the keys in six rows, but some laptops use only five or
        even four rows to save space. The most popular layout is called QWERTY, which is based on the first six letters
        on them. The QWERTY design was made so that the most common letters would not make the moving parts of a
        mechanical typewriter "jam", or stop working. Now, even though most people do not use typewriters anymore, the
        design stayed because people were used to it. Other layouts have been developed, for example the Dvorak
        keyboard, which puts the most common letters in the places that are easiest to reach.Keystroke logging is making
        a record of each key that is pressed. Keystroke logging can be used to measure employee activity. Hackers can
        also use keystroke logging to get private information, such as passwords. This can be done by putting a piece of
        hardware in the keyboard or on the cable, or by installing malware in the computer. A wireless keyboard makes it
        especially easy for the hacker to detect the wireless signals.

        The use of any keyboard may cause repetitive strain injury to the hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The
        risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent, short breaks to get up and walk around, a couple of times
        every hour. Users should also vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When
        using a keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and
        mouse positioned so that they are comfortable to use. The chair height and keyboard should be adjusted so that
        the wrists are straight, and not resting on sharp edges of tables or the computers themselves. Some
        technology ranging from special keyboards to pen-tablet interfaces or speech recognition software can reduce the
        risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently.

        Researchers are studying if keyboards can spread diseases. Some keyboards were found to contain five times more
        germs than a toilet seat.</p>
    <h1>Microphone</h1>
    <p>A microphone, sometimes referred to as a mike or mic , converts sound into an
        electrical signal.

        Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, tape recorders, hearing aids, motion picture
        production, live and recorded audio engineering, in radio and television broadcasting and in computers for
        recording voice.Sound passes through the air in waves, and as was said above, the microphone turns the sound
        wave into an electrical wave. Different kinds of microphones will turn the sound waves into electricity in
        different ways.


        Carbon button - This is the first kind to become commonplace, being used in most 20th century telephones. Sound
        waves, by compressing and decompressing a piece of carbon, change the amount of electric current flowing in the
        wire, thus creating electrical waves. This kind became rarer late in the century, due in part to lack of high
        fidelity.
        Dynamic - This uses a round plastic or rubber disk connected to a wire coil in order to turn sound into
        electricity. The sound wave hits the disk which vibrates as a result. This vibration moves the coil back and
        forth near a magnet very quickly in order to create an electrical current. The dynamic microphone is the exact
        opposite of a speaker which uses an electrical current to move the coil, which moves the disk. Then the disk
        makes sound.


        Ribbon - This is similar to a Dynamic microphone. A thin, small sheet of metal (tin or aluminum usually) hangs
        between two magnets. When sound hits the thin piece of metal, the metal vibrates. That vibration creates an
        electrical signal in the metal.
        Condenser - This uses two small metal plates to create an electrical current. Basically two small metal plates
        are placed very near to each other and electricity is run through the plates. This creates an electric field
        between the two plates. When sound hits these plates, the plates vibrate. The vibration makes small changes in
        the electric field. These changes create the electrical signal.
        Crystal or ceramic microphones use piezoelectricity.</p>
    <h1>Webcam</h1>
    <p>A webcam is a video camera that connects to a computer, and can let people see each other over the Internet. Most
        people that have webcams use them with an instant messenger to see each other at the same time. Webcams can also
        be used for recording videos and video blogs. The webcam can be part of a computer, mobile phone or it can be an
        independent device.The first webcam was developed in 1991 at Cambridge University and the first commercial
        camera started in 1994 and was made by Logitech.</p>
